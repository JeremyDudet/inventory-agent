# App Flow Document

## Introduction

This application is a voice-driven AI agent designed for cafes and restaurants to manage their inventory using natural, real-time conversation. The main goal of the user journey is to allow staff, managers, inventory specialists, and owners to update and query inventory with minimal friction through voice commands while receiving immediate feedback. The system is built to handle multiple simultaneous users, maintain context through multi-turn dialogue, offer adaptive confirmation strategies, and provide a seamless fallback text-based interface when voice interaction fails. The application is designed with a cloud-based, containerized backend and a mobile-friendly friendly interface that ensures low latency and secure data handling.

## Onboarding and Sign-In/Sign-Up

When a new user or an existing user opens the app on a mobile device or tablet, they first encounter a simple, clear landing page that welcomes them. New users are presented with an onboarding flow that guides them through the registration process. They are asked to provide only minimal personal details, select their role (such as Staff, Manager, Inventory Specialist, Owner, or Read-Only), and accept the voice-specific permissions. In addition to email-based sign-up, social login options are available to simplify the access process. Users who have an account simply sign in using their credentials. For those who forget their password, a recovery option is provided that prompts them to enter their registered email and follow verification steps to reset it. Once authenticated, the user session begins and the app stores a unique session identifier to manage context and permissions throughout the interaction.

## Main Dashboard or Home Page

After a user is successfully logged in, they are directed to a dashboard that is tailored to their role and responsibilities. Staff see a simplified interface with large visual elements displaying key inventory counts, a prominent update area, and a clearly marked “Start Listening” button to initiate voice interaction. Managers and inventory specialists are provided with additional options such as detailed audit logs, reorder thresholds, and administrative settings, while owners have access to global system settings and aggregated reports. The main screen includes a header with clear navigation options and status indicators for system connectivity and current session context. Users can easily navigate from the dashboard to other parts of the application such as detailed item views, historical audit trails, and settings pages.

## Detailed Feature Flows and Page Transitions

When a user wishes to update inventory, they click on the “Start Listening” button on the dashboard. This action activates the voice interface where the system begins capturing the audio using a streaming ASR pipeline. As the user speaks, a partial transcription appears on the screen in real time, allowing the user to verify that their command is being recognized correctly. Once the spoken command is fully captured, it is passed through an NLP pipeline that uses a pre-trained language model to understand the intent. If the system has high confidence in the command and the update is routine (for example, adding a small number of items), it provides an implicit confirmation by updating the database and echoing the change on the screen. However, if the speech recognition confidence is low, if the input is ambiguous, or if the action involves a large change in inventory, the system pauses and explicitly asks for confirmation. The user is then presented with a voice prompt or an on-screen dialog asking for a yes or no answer, ensuring that any critical or ambiguous changes are verified before they are applied. Once the command is confirmed, the inventory database is updated in real time and an immediate response is generated via both synthesized speech and on-screen notifications. Throughout the flow, users can transition between voice commands and the fallback text-based interface which mirrors the voice flow in terms of validations and confirmation prompts. This design ensures that even in noisy environments or if the voice recognition fails, users can maintain a consistent and connected journey through their updates and queries.

## Settings and Account Management

Users can access a dedicated section from the main dashboard to manage their personal information and account settings. In this area, users can update their profile details, configure voice preference settings, adjust notification preferences, and, if applicable, manage billing information from a secure and easy-to-navigate page. Role-specific functionalities are also available where managers and owners have additional options to invite new users, assign roles, or review audit trails. The settings page is designed so that once changes are saved or updates confirmed, users can return to the main dashboard seamlessly with minimal disruption to their session. The interface ensures that all updates are immediately reflected in the user’s active session and that the application context remains intact across all changes.

## Error States and Alternate Paths

If users enter invalid data or the system cannot accurately process a voice command, clear error messages are displayed on the screen accompanied by synthesized voice responses. For instance, if the voice recognition system is uncertain about the command or the input is ambiguous, the system prompts the user with clear instructions on how to correct the input. In cases of connectivity issues or when the speech recognition repeatedly fails to capture the voice command correctly, the application automatically offers the fallback text-based interface. In this fallback mode, users are shown a text input field where they can enter the command manually. If a user attempts a restricted action or an operation exceeds their permission level, the system notifies them with a polite message and provides a prompt to either cancel the action or request managerial assistance. Users can also ping managers through the app to propose changes. Similar to a version control pull request, for example. Embedded error logging ensures that any issues encountered during the process are recorded, allowing for reviews and continuous improvement of the system’s performance.

## Conclusion and Overall App Journey

From the initial onboarding to everyday use, the application offers a seamless journey that combines robust voice-driven interaction with a dependable fallback text interface. New users are quickly onboarded with an intuitive sign-up process that includes clear explanations of role-based access and voice-specific permissions. Once logged in, users navigate through a personalized dashboard that highlights key inventory data while offering easy navigation to more specialized features. The core flow begins with the “Start Listening” function, where voice commands are processed in real time with adaptive confirmations to ensure accuracy. Detailed command processing, context-aware updates, and immediate user feedback create a smooth and highly responsive experience even in challenging operational environments. Whether a command is confirmed implicitly in routine updates or explicitly in ambiguous or critical cases, the user experience remains coherent and connected.\
A successful user experience is contingent of a high speed of inventory input with 100% accuracy, and/or a frictionless ability to course correct errors. Finally, account management and comprehensive error handling provide continuous support and stability throughout the application’s use. Overall, the system enables cafes and restaurants to efficiently manage inventory with advanced voice interaction, while ensuring data integrity, security, and consistent performance even during peak operational periods.
