Test Failure Analysis
====================

1. Error Type Categories
-----------------------

A. Assertion Errors (Object/Value Mismatches)
   Count: 12 failures
   Pattern: "Expected object to match expected values"
   Examples:
   - Expected: action="add", isComplete=true
     Received: action="", isComplete=false
   - Expected: unit=""
     Received: unit="units"
   - Expected: confidence=0.95, isComplete=true
     Received: confidence=0.6, isComplete=false

B. Array Length Mismatches
   Count: 3 failures
   Pattern: "Expected array length: X, Received length: Y"
   Examples:
   - Expected length: 2, Received length: 3
   - Expected length: 3, Received length: 5
   - Expected length: 2, Received length: 1

C. Boolean Value Mismatches
   Count: 1 failure
   Pattern: "Expected: false, Received: true"
   Example:
   - "should clear context after complete commands"

D. Confidence Score Mismatches
   Count: 2 failures
   Pattern: "Expected: X, Received: Y"
   Examples:
   - Expected: 0.45, Received: 0.95
   - Expected: 0.8, Received: 0.95

2. Module Analysis
-----------------

A. NLP Service (nlpService.test.ts)
   Total Failures: 14
   Error Types:
   - Assertion Errors: 10
   - Array Length: 3
   - Boolean: 1
   Key Issues:
   1. Command Parsing
      - Empty actions being returned
      - Incorrect confidence scores
      - Incomplete command handling
   2. Context Management
      - Context not being cleared properly
      - Incorrect merging of command contexts
   3. Multiple Command Processing
      - Extra commands being generated
      - Incorrect command splitting

B. Voice Command Processing (voiceCommand.test.ts)
   Total Failures: 2
   Error Types:
   - Confidence Score Mismatches: 2
   Key Issues:
   1. Confidence Scoring
      - Incomplete commands getting high confidence
      - Missing quantity handling

3. Root Cause Analysis
---------------------

A. Command Processing Issues
   - Inconsistent handling of empty/incomplete commands
   - Over-aggressive confidence scoring
   - Context management not properly implemented

B. NLP Service Implementation
   - Multiple command splitting logic needs improvement
   - Context merging needs refinement
   - Confidence scoring algorithm needs adjustment

C. Voice Command Processing
   - Confidence scoring needs to be more conservative for incomplete commands
   - Missing quantity detection needs improvement

4. Recommended Fix Priority
--------------------------

1. High Priority
   - Fix command parsing in NLP service (affects 10 tests)
   - Address context management issues (affects 4 tests)
   - Fix multiple command processing (affects 3 tests)

2. Medium Priority
   - Adjust confidence scoring algorithm
   - Improve incomplete command handling
   - Fix voice command processing issues

3. Low Priority
   - Refine unit handling
   - Optimize command splitting logic

5. Code Coverage Impact
----------------------

Areas needing immediate attention:
1. NLP Service (67.57% coverage)
   - Focus on command processing paths
   - Add tests for edge cases
   - Improve context management coverage

2. Voice Command Processing
   - Add tests for confidence scoring
   - Improve coverage of incomplete command handling

Note: While other services have lower coverage (authService: 4.41%, confirmationService: 5.52%, inventoryService: 9.3%), the current failing tests are primarily in the NLP and Voice Command processing areas.
