# Tech Stack Document

## Introduction

This project is a voice-driven AI agent built for cafes and restaurants that enables staff to manage inventory through natural, real-time conversation. The system is designed to make everyday tasks as simple as speaking a command, while ensuring quick and accurate feedback. The technology choices support low-latency responses, scalable performance, and a robust mix of voice and manual interfaces, all while keeping the user experience intuitive and reliable.

## Frontend Technologies

The frontend of the application is built using React with Vite, a modern framework that helps create responsive and interactive user interfaces. This choice ensures that the application works smoothly on mobile devices and tablets, which are common in busy cafe and restaurant environments. The user-friendly design incorporates both a clear voice interface and a fallback text-based option that activates when speech recognition is challenged by noisy conditions or technical interruptions. The emphasis on a simple, accessible layout with big visuals and easy navigation means that every user, from staff to managers, can interact with the system effortlessly. Tailwind CSS is used for styling.

## Backend Technologies

The backend is powered by an Express-based setup enhanced by Bun.js, which provides a fast and efficient runtime environment. This layer is responsible for handling voice inputs, sending them to third-party speech-to-text and natural language processing services, and updating the inventory database in near real time. The inventory data is managed by Supabase using PostgreSQL, ensuring that all storage is reliable and secure. This backend framework efficiently coordinates tasks such as session management, role-based access, and context-aware communications so that every command is accurately interpreted and the inventory is updated swiftly.

## Infrastructure and Deployment

The application is designed with scalability and speed in mind. It uses Docker to containerize both the core backend services and various microservices. Kubernetes or managed container platforms help orchestrate these containers, ensuring that the system can scale smoothly as demand increases. Cloud hosting on providers like AWS, in combination with deployment platforms such as Vercel for the React frontend, minimizes latency by co-locating the services geographically. Real-time interactions are maintained using persistent WebSocket connections. This architectural design guarantees quick responses, robust performance, and simplified deployment, all of which are critical for maintaining those sub-1-second response times during peak usage.

## Third-Party Integrations

The project leverages several state-of-the-art third-party services to provide its key functionalities. Deepgram is used for real-time speech-to-text conversion, ensuring that voice commands are transcribed with high accuracy. In addition, a pre-trained language model such as GPT-4 (or Claude) handles natural language understanding and generation, forming the core of the conversational AI experience. These integrations are seamlessly woven into the backend, providing the intelligence behind adaptive confirmation strategies and swift inventory updates, while additional services may be incorporated for text-to-speech conversion and further enhancements as the system evolves.

## Security and Performance Considerations

Security is a top priority throughout the tech stack. All communications, including voice data and inventory updates, are encrypted using TLS to protect data in transit. The system enforces strict role-based access controls and implements secure storage protocols in the Supabase/PostgreSQL database to ensure sensitive information remains safe. Performance enhancements are achieved through asynchronous processing, caching strategies, and persistent WebSocket connections that collectively maintain the sub-1-second response threshold even during concurrent operations. Robust logging and monitoring help in continuously assessing and improving both system performance and security, giving users confidence in the reliability of the system.

## Conclusion and Overall Tech Stack Summary

In summary, this tech stack is carefully chosen to meet the demands of a fast-paced, voice-driven inventory management system in a restaurant or cafe setting. The frontend powered by React ensures an intuitive user experience with both voice and fallback text interfaces, while the backend built on Express and enhanced by Bun.js delivers rapid processing of voice commands. The use of containerization with Docker and orchestration through Kubernetes, along with deployment on AWS and Vercel, ensures scalable infrastructure with low latency. Integrations with Deepgram for ASR and GPT-4 for NLP provide advanced conversational capabilities, and strong security and performance measures guarantee data integrity and quick response times. Every element of the tech stack works in harmony to create a responsive, secure, and user-friendly solution that stands out in the realm of voice-based inventory management.
