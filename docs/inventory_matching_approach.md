Inventory Matching Feature

We'll use a small llm, like gpt-3.5-turbo along with embeddings to properly find item matches.

By using a smaller, lightweight LLM and pairing it with efficient embedding-based matching, we keep response times quick.
Accuracy and Flexibility: The LLM handles messy or ambiguous queries (e.g., correcting "papper" to "paper"), while embeddings find the best matches in the inventory based on meaning, not just exact words.
Scalability: This approach works for small and large inventories alike, adapting instantly to whatever data the user provides.

How It Works
Here’s the step-by-step process for your app:

1. User Uploads Inventory
When a user uploads their inventory (e.g., a list like "Paper Cups (12oz)", "Coffee Filters (Large)", "Whole Milk"), the app generates vector embeddings for each item name.
These embeddings are created using a pre-trained model (e.g., Sentence-BERT) and stored for fast lookup. This happens once per upload and doesn’t require training.

2. User Enters a Query
For a query like "Add 10 large coffee filters":
The smaller LLM preprocesses the input:
Corrects spelling (e.g., "papper" → "paper").
Extracts key terms (e.g., "coffee filters", "large").
Understands intent (e.g., "add" as a command).
This step uses the LLM’s general language skills, so no inventory-specific training is needed.

3. Matching with Embeddings
The preprocessed query (e.g., "coffee filters large") is converted into a vector embedding.
The app compares this embedding to the inventory’s precomputed embeddings using a fast similarity search (e.g., cosine similarity).
The closest match (e.g., "Coffee Filters (Large)") is returned quickly.

4. Handling Edge Cases
If the match isn’t clear (e.g., similarity score is low), the app can:
Suggest top options (e.g., "Did you mean 'Coffee Filters (Large)' or 'Coffee Filters (Small)'?").
Ask the user to clarify, ensuring a smooth experience.

Example in Action - Let’s say a user uploads this inventory:

"Paper Cups (12oz)"
"Paper Cups (16oz)"
"Coffee Filters (Large)"
"Whole Milk"

Query 1: "Add 8 papper plates"
LLM corrects "papper" to "paper" and identifies "plates".
Embedding search looks for "paper plates".
If "Paper Plates" isn’t in the inventory, it might suggest "Paper Cups (12oz)" or ask for clarification, or ask if they want to add Paper Plates to their inventory.

Query 2: "We have 5 gallons of milk"
LLM extracts "milk" and "5 gallons".
Embedding matches "Whole Milk" (assuming it’s the only milk type).
If multiple milk types existed, it would use session context or prompt the user for more specificity.

Query 3: "Add 10 large coffee filters"
LLM extracts "large coffee filters".
Embedding finds "Coffee Filters (Large)" as the best match.

Features for Continuous Improvement
Since you want the app to improve for individual users over time, we can add these optional features without requiring pre-training:

User Feedback Loop:
If a match is a false positive, let users correct it allow the system to undo a previous action that was a false-positive by having the user click an undo button, or speak an undo command in natural language (e.g., "No, I meant '16oz cups' not '12oz cups'").
Allow user to input rules so that the system can adjust future matches for that user (e.g., prioritize "16oz" when they say "cups").

Synonym Learning:
If a user corrects "pods" to "capsules," the app remembers this as a synonym for their inventory, improving accuracy over time.

Session Context:
Track recent queries to resolve ambiguity (e.g., if they just added "12oz cups," assume "cups" refers to that size).

Optional Fine-Tuning (Later):
If a user opts in and provides enough feedback, you could fine-tune a personalized model for them in the background. This isn’t required upfront and can be a premium feature.

Why This Meets Our Goals
Works Immediately: No pre-training means the app is ready as soon as the inventory is uploaded. The LLM and embeddings adapt to any data instantly.
Fast Responses: A smaller LLM plus precomputed embeddings ensures quick preprocessing and matching, even for large inventories.
Flexible and Accurate: The LLM handles diverse queries, and embeddings capture semantic similarity, so it works across different naming styles (e.g., "coffee pods" vs. "coffee capsules").
Improves Over Time: Feedback features let the app learn user preferences without needing initial training.

Next Steps
To implement this:

Choose a smaller LLM (e.g., Open AI's gpt-3.5-turbo) for preprocessing.
Use a pre-trained embedding model (e.g., Open AI's text-embedding-3-small) for inventory and query embeddings.
Integrate a similarity search tool (e.g., Supabase Vector database) he matching logic always reflects the current state of the inventory, so queries match against the latest item information.
We can use Supabase to build different types of search features for the app, including:
- Semantic search: search by meaning rather than exact keywords
- Keyword search: search by words or phrases
- Hybrid search: combine semantic search with keyword search

2. Handle Item Deletions
What to Do: When a user deletes an item, remove it from the matching system entirely.
How It Works: Delete the item’s embedding or entry from the database or index used for matching.
Why It Matters: This prevents outdated or removed items from appearing in future query results, keeping matches relevant.

3. Add New Items Seamlessly
What to Do: When a user adds a new item, include it in the matching system immediately.
How It Works: Generate an embedding for the new item and add it to the database or index.
Why It Matters: New items become available for matching right away, ensuring the system stays up-to-date with the user’s inventory.

4. Manage Significant Changes Carefully
What to Do: For major changes (e.g., renaming "Paper Cups" to "Eco-Friendly Tumblers"), optionally support a transition period.
How It Works: Temporarily keep both the old and new versions of the item in the matching system. For example, store both embeddings and phase out the old one after a set time (e.g., 30 days).
Why It Matters: This helps maintain matching accuracy for users or queries still referencing the old name, smoothing the transition.

5. Optimize for Bulk Updates
What to Do: If a user uploads a new inventory file or makes many changes at once, process these efficiently.
How It Works: Support incremental updates—only regenerate embeddings for changed items rather than rebuilding the entire system.
Why It Matters: This reduces performance delays, making the system scalable for users with large inventories.

6. Provide Clear User Feedback
What to Do: Inform users about the impact of their changes.
How It Works: Show notifications like "Renaming this item may affect how it matches future queries" or prompt them to fix errors (e.g., invalid names).
Why It Matters: This keeps users aware and in control, improving their experience and reducing mistakes.

7. Use Efficient Technology
What to Do: Rely on a system that can handle frequent updates without slowing down.
How It Works: Use a vector database (e.g., Pinecone or Faiss) that supports fast additions, updates, and deletions of embeddings.
Why It Matters: This ensures the system remains responsive, even with constant inventory changes.
