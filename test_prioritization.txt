Test Fix Prioritization Plan
===========================

1. Critical Infrastructure Issues
--------------------------------
Priority: Highest
Impact: Database and core service functionality
Status: No critical infrastructure issues found in current failures
- No database connection errors
- No test setup issues
- Core services (auth, inventory) tests are passing

2. Core NLP Service Command Processing
-------------------------------------
Priority: High
Impact: 10 failing tests
Root Cause: Command parsing logic in NLP service
Affected Tests:
- Multiple command processing
- Context management
- Command completion status

Action Items:
1. Fix command parsing logic
   - Address empty action returns
   - Fix confidence scoring
   - Improve incomplete command handling
   - Expected to fix 10 assertion errors

2. Fix context management
   - Implement proper context clearing
   - Fix context merging logic
   - Expected to fix 4 related tests

3. Fix multiple command processing
   - Address array length mismatches
   - Fix command splitting logic
   - Expected to fix 3 array length errors

3. Voice Command Processing
--------------------------
Priority: Medium
Impact: 2 failing tests
Root Cause: Confidence scoring algorithm
Affected Tests:
- Incomplete command handling
- Missing quantity detection

Action Items:
1. Adjust confidence scoring
   - Make scoring more conservative for incomplete commands
   - Fix missing quantity handling
   - Expected to fix 2 confidence score mismatches

4. Code Coverage Improvements
----------------------------
Priority: Medium-Low
Impact: Future test reliability
Areas:
- NLP Service (67.57% coverage)
- Voice Command Processing
- Other services (auth, confirmation, inventory)

Action Plan
==========

Phase 1: Core NLP Service Fixes
-----------------------------
1. Command Parsing (Week 1)
   - Fix empty action returns
   - Implement proper confidence scoring
   - Add tests for edge cases
   - Expected to resolve 10 failures

2. Context Management (Week 1-2)
   - Implement context clearing
   - Fix context merging
   - Add context management tests
   - Expected to resolve 4 failures

3. Multiple Command Processing (Week 2)
   - Fix command splitting
   - Address array length issues
   - Add multiple command tests
   - Expected to resolve 3 failures

Phase 2: Voice Command Processing
-------------------------------
1. Confidence Scoring (Week 2-3)
   - Adjust scoring algorithm
   - Fix incomplete command handling
   - Add confidence scoring tests
   - Expected to resolve 2 failures

Phase 3: Coverage Improvements
----------------------------
1. NLP Service Coverage (Week 3)
   - Add tests for command processing paths
   - Improve context management coverage
   - Add edge case tests

2. Other Services Coverage (Week 4)
   - Add tests for auth service
   - Add tests for confirmation service
   - Add tests for inventory service

Rationale for Prioritization
--------------------------
1. NLP Service is prioritized highest because:
   - Has the most failing tests (14)
   - Core functionality for command processing
   - Issues affect multiple test categories
   - Fixes will improve overall system reliability

2. Voice Command Processing is second because:
   - Fewer failing tests (2)
   - Depends on NLP service fixes
   - Simpler issues to resolve

3. Coverage improvements are last because:
   - Not causing current failures
   - Can be addressed after core functionality is fixed
   - Will improve future test reliability

Next Steps
----------
1. Begin with NLP service command parsing fixes
2. Create test cases for each fix
3. Implement fixes incrementally
4. Run test suite after each fix
5. Document any new issues discovered

This prioritization focuses on fixing the most impactful issues first while maintaining a clear path to improving overall test coverage and system reliability.
