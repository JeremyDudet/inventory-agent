Below is the step-by-step implementation plan for the voice-driven inventory management system. Each step references the relevant document section (PRD, App Flow, Tech Stack, etc.) and specifies file paths or commands.

## Phase 1: Environment Setup

**Step 1:** Verify if Node.js v20.2.1 is installed. If not, install Node.js v20.2.1 as required by the Tech Stack. *Reference: PRD Section Non-Functional (Performance) & Tech Stack (Core Tools)*

**Step 2:** Install Bun (from <https://bun.sh>) to run the Bun.js/Express backend. *Reference: Tech Stack Document*

**Step 3:** Install Docker (latest stable release) for containerization. Validate Docker installation by running `docker --version`. *Reference: PRD Section Deployment & Tech Stack (Docker)*

**Step 4:** Initialize a Git repository with a `main` branch. Create the following directory structure at the project root:

*   `/frontend`
*   `/backend`
*   `/infra`

*Reference: PRD Section 1.4 (Onboarding) & Developer Guidelines*

**Step 5:** Create a global configuration file `.env` at the root of the frontend and backend directories to store environment variables (e.g., API keys, DB connection strings). *Reference: Security & Deployment Sections in PRD*

## Phase 2: Frontend Development

**Step 6:** Initialize a new React project inside `/frontend` (using your preferred starter, e.g., Create React App). *Reference: Tech Stack Document (React) & Frontend Guidelines*

**Step 7:** Configure React Router for pages such as `/login`, `/dashboard`, and `/manual-update`. Create file: `/frontend/src/App.ts`. *Reference: App Flow Document (User Onboarding and Dashboard)*

**Step 8:** Implement the Login and Onboarding screen in `/frontend/src/pages/Login.ts`. This screen should allow users to select their role (Staff, Manager, Inventory Specialist, Owner, Read-Only). *Reference: PRD Section User Flow & Onboarding*

**Step 9:** Develop the Dashboard view in `/frontend/src/pages/Dashboard.ts` that displays real-time inventory data and contextual session information. *Reference: PRD Section Dashboard and Inventory Overview*

**Step 10:** Create a voice control component at `/frontend/src/components/VoiceControl.ts` that includes a prominent “Start Listening” button. This component will initiate voice streaming via WebSocket. *Reference: App Flow – Initiating Voice Interaction*

**Step 11:** Develop a fallback text-based input component at `/frontend/src/components/FallbackInput.ts` for manual updates when voice recognition fails. *Reference: PRD Section Fallback UI & App Flow – Fallback Interface*

**Step 12:** Implement state management (using Context API or Redux) within `/frontend/src/state/` to store session data, including recent commands and role info. *Reference: PRD Section Context Awareness & Multi-User Session Management*

**Step 13:** Create an API service file at `/frontend/src/services/api.ts` with fetch to handle calls to backend endpoints (e.g., login, inventory updates). *Reference: PRD Section Role-Based Access & Adaptive Confirmation*

**Step 14:** Validate the frontend build by running `bun start` from `/frontend` and checking that the login page and routing work as expected.

## Phase 3: Backend Development

**Step 15:** Initialize a Bun.js/Express application in the `/backend` directory. Create file `/backend/app.ts`. *Reference: PRD Section Monolith Architecture and Tech Stack (Bun.js/Express)*

**Step 16:** Set up an Express server with Bun.js by installing necessary dependencies. Validate by running the server locally and confirming on `http://localhost:3000`.

**Step 17:** Create a user authentication endpoint `POST /api/login` in `/backend/routes/auth.ts` to handle login and role assignment. *Reference: PRD Section User Onboarding and Authentication*

**Step 18:** Create inventory update endpoint `POST /api/inventory/update` in `/backend/routes/inventory.ts` to process both voice and manual updates. *Reference: PRD Section Voice-Driven Interaction & Inventory Database*

**Step 19:** Implement database connection logic for Supabase/PostgreSQL in `/backend/config/db.ts` ensuring encrypted connections. Validate by connecting to the database. *Reference: PRD Section Database & Security; Tech Stack Document (Supabase/PostgreSQL)*

**Step 20:** Develop a WebSocket server using Socket.IO in `/backend/src/websocket.ts` to support real-time communications with the frontend. Validate by testing a dummy message exchange. *Reference: PRD Section Real-Time Conversational Architecture*

**Step 21:** Add middleware for role-based access control in `/backend/middleware/auth.ts` so each endpoint checks the user’s role. *Reference: PRD Section Role-Based Access Control*

**Step 22:** Create a service for adaptive confirmation logic in `/backend/services/confirmationService.ts`. This service should:

*   Query ASR confidence scores
*   Determine whether the update requires explicit confirmation (ambiguous input, low confidence, large quantity, or unrecognized item) *Reference: PRD Section Adaptive Confirmation Strategy*

**Step 23:** Integrate pre-trained NLP model (GPT-4/Claude API) calls within an orchestration service in `/backend/services/nlpService.ts` to parse commands and generate structured actions. Validate with sample payloads. *Reference: PRD Section NLP Processing & Adaptive Confirmation*

**Step 24:** Implement robust error handling middleware in `/backend/middleware/errorHandler.ts` to capture and log errors (and send appropriate responses). *Reference: PRD Section Error Handling & Fallback Mechanisms*

## Phase 4: Integration

**Step 25:** In the frontend API service (`/frontend/src/services/api.ts`), configure calls to the backend endpoints (e.g., `/api/login` and `/api/inventory/update`). *Reference: App Flow – User Onboarding and Real-Time Execution*

**Step 26:** Integrate the WebSocket connection from the frontend voice control component (in `/frontend/src/components/VoiceControl.ts`) with the backend Socket.IO server to exchange real-time updates. *Reference: PRD Section Real-Time Conversational Architecture*

**Step 27:** Connect the authentication flow by ensuring that upon a successful `POST /api/login`, the frontend stores session tokens/information for subsequent API calls. *Reference: PRD Section User Flow & Security*

**Step 28:** Validate role-based permissions by triggering test requests from different user roles and ensuring that restricted actions (e.g., large inventory changes) trigger explicit confirmation. *Reference: PRD Section Role-Based Access and Adaptive Confirmations*

**Step 29:** Test the adaptive confirmation workflow by simulating various scenarios:

*   High confidence and routine update (implicit confirmation)
*   Ambiguous item name or low confidence (explicit confirmation process) *Reference: PRD Section Adaptive Confirmation Strategy & Q&A: Confirmation Guidelines*

## Phase 5: Deployment

**Step 30:** Create a Dockerfile for the backend in the `/backend` directory that describes building the Bun.js/Express service. *Reference: PRD Section Deployment & Tech Stack (Docker)*

**Step 31:** Create a Dockerfile for the frontend (if needed) in `/frontend` (or rely on Vercel’s build process).

**Step 32:** In the `/infra` directory, create a Kubernetes deployment configuration file `k8s-deployment.yaml` for the backend service. Specify container resource requests, autoscaling settings, and the AWS region `us-east-1`. *Reference: PRD Section Scalable Deployment & Cloud Hosting*

**Step 33:** Set up a CI/CD pipeline (e.g., via GitHub Actions) by creating a workflow file at `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` that builds, tests, and deploys backend and frontend containers. *Reference: PRD Section Deployment and Monitoring*

**Step 34:** Configure Vercel to deploy the React frontend by linking the repository and setting necessary environment variables. *Reference: Tech Stack Document (React, Vercel)*

**Step 35:** Ensure HTTPS/TLS configurations are active on both frontend and backend by updating server settings and Vercel configurations. *Reference: PRD Section Security & API Network Security*

**Step 36:** Deploy the backend containerized service to the selected cloud platform (e.g., AWS ECS/Fargate or Kubernetes on AWS) and validate the service endpoint with `curl` commands (e.g., `curl -X POST http://<backend-url>/api/login`).

**Step 37:** Conduct end-to-end testing using Cypress (or similar) to simulate voice commands (or fallback text) from a mobile device. Validate the complete flow (voice ASR → NLP → DB update → response via TTS and on-screen notifications), ensuring sub-1-second latency. *Reference: PRD Section Non-Functional Requirements (Performance)*

**Step 38:** Set up monitoring for backend logs and performance metrics using CloudWatch (or Prometheus/Grafana) to observe real-time latency, error rates, and resource usage. *Reference: PRD Section Monitoring & Scaling*

**Step 39:** Validate data security by testing that all API calls and WebSocket connections use TLS (e.g., by manual inspection and automated tests). *Reference: Q&A: Security and Data Privacy*

**Step 40:** Validate the database integration by performing test inventory updates and verifying that the corresponding records are correctly inserted/updated in Supabase/PostgreSQL. *Reference: PRD Section Inventory Database Schema*

**Step 41:** Test the fallback UI by manually triggering low-confidence scenarios (simulate noise) and verifying that the manual text input becomes available and functions as expected. *Reference: PRD Section Fallback User Interface*

**Step 42:** Run end-to-end integration tests (via a tool like Postman or custom scripts) that simulate multiple users concurrently updating inventory to verify session isolation and performance. *Reference: PRD Section Multi-User and Session Management*

**Step 43:** Review audit logs and error logs to ensure that misinterpretations, explicit confirmations, and barge-in interruptions are being correctly recorded. *Reference: PRD Section Error Handling & Audit Logging*

**Step 44:** Verify that role-based controls are enforced by testing that users with lower-level roles (e.g., Staff) cannot execute high-risk commands without additional confirmations. *Reference: PRD Section Role-Based Access Control & Q&A: User Roles*

**Step 45:** Document the manual onboarding and offboarding procedures, emphasizing the painless process of populating the inventory database for initial setup and future integrations. *Reference: PRD Section Onboarding and Inventory Database*

**Step 46:** Run a final full system test on a dedicated mobile device (smartphone/tablet) to simulate the typical hardware and network environment. Confirm real-time updates, voice recognition, fallback UI, and secure communications. *Reference: Q&A: Mobile Device Environment & PRD User Flow*

**Step 47:** Finalize and archive detailed deployment instructions and diagrams in the `/infra` folder for future maintenance.

**Step 48:** Prepare a post-deployment review process to monitor early user feedback, adaptive confirmation logs, and potential areas for improvement. *Reference: PRD Section Error Handling & Adaptive Learning*

**Step 49:** Ensure all secrets and environment variables are stored securely using a secrets manager (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager) and that access rules are in place. *Reference: Q&A: Security and Data Privacy*

**Step 50:** Announce the MVP rollout to initial users and plan for periodic updates based on feedback, ensuring scalability and further integration options with legacy systems in the future. *Reference: PRD Section Conclusion & Future Integrations*

This plan outlines all necessary steps from setting up the development environment to deploying and validating the complete voice-driven inventory management system, ensuring adherence to the detailed requirements in the PRD and supporting documents.
