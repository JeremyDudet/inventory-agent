Why These Colors Work
These colors are designed to feel cozy and approachable, echoing the café-inspired vibe of the light mode while adapting to a darker setting. The darker shades like Deep Taupe and Dark Sage Green maintain warmth, while Muted Coral and Light Slate Blue add subtle pops of interest. The Dark Charcoal background paired with Light Gray text ensures readability and meets accessibility standards (e.g., WCAG 2.1 AA contrast ratios).

This palette gives dark mode users a seamless, comfortable experience that aligns with the original design’s charm. Let me know if you’d like more details!
